# A Replication of Mahowald et al. (2013) 

Replicating the multiple-choice sentence completion part of the behavioral study from [this paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027712002107?via%3Dihub).

## Hypotheses

Our main hypothesis is the same as the conclusion in the original paper: participants will choose shorter word forms in predictive (supportive) contexts and longer forms in neutral contexts. In our analysis using a mixed-effect logistic regression, we will use the original predictors of supportive vs. neutral context and answer choice ordering. We may extend our analysis further by looking at other factors, such as the difference in number of characters, number of syllables, frequency, or surprisal between the long and short forms, and ambiguity. We predict that some of these additional factors may correlate with the variation in results across word pairs. 

## Stimuli

We are using the same sentence items and fillers as the original paper, provided by Kyle Mahowald.
